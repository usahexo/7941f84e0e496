<h1 id="5-Dungeons-Every-Player-Should-Clear-For-the-Mentor-Roulette"><a href="#5-Dungeons-Every-Player-Should-Clear-For-the-Mentor-Roulette" class="headerlink" title="5 Dungeons Every Player Should Clear For the Mentor Roulette"></a>5 Dungeons Every Player Should Clear For the Mentor Roulette</h1><p>Once you hit level 60, it’s time to start gearing up for The Mentor Roulette. This is a high-level dungeon where you can receive powerful rewards - but only if your team is up to the challenge.</p>
<p>If you’re looking to maximize your chances of success, you’ll want to clear five specific dungeons first. Here’s a list of them, along with some tips on how to beat them:</p>
<ol>
<li>Maze of the Blue Dragon</li>
</ol>
<p>This dungeon is all about teamwork and strategy. The key to clearing it is to focus on taking out the blue dragons first. Don’t let them breathe fire on your party, or you’ll be in for a tough battle.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Hammerknell Fortress</li>
</ol>
<p>This is a difficult dungeon, but the rewards are well worth it. Make sure to take advantage of the choke points in the hallway, and have a healer ready to go for the final boss fight.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Sanctum of Blood</li>
</ol>
<p>This dungeon can be tricky if you’re not prepared for it. The best way to deal with the bosses is to use ranged DPS characters and keep your healer alive.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>The Lost City of Teshar</li>
</ol>
<p>This dungeon is all about timing and speed. You’ll need to move quickly through the rooms and avoid the traps - otherwise, you’ll be in for a long battle.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>The Court of Oryx</li>
</ol>
<p>This dungeon is definitely one of the more challenging ones on this list. Make sure your team is well-equipped before attempting it, and focus on taking out the courtiers first.</p>
<h1 id="5-Dungeons-to-Speed-Through-for-the-Mentor-Roulette-in-Wildz"><a href="#5-Dungeons-to-Speed-Through-for-the-Mentor-Roulette-in-Wildz" class="headerlink" title="5 Dungeons to Speed Through for the Mentor Roulette in Wildz"></a>5 Dungeons to Speed Through for the Mentor Roulette in Wildz</h1><p>The Mentor Roulette in Wildz is a fun, fast-paced game mode that can be completed relatively quickly, even if you’re not very familiar with the game. Here are five dungeons that are especially good for the Mentor Roulette:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Catacombs</li>
</ol>
<p>This dungeon is short and straightforward, and there are plenty of enemies to defeat along the way. The final boss is also relatively easy, making this a great option for a new player.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>The Lair of Draconis</li>
</ol>
<p>This dungeon is another good choice for new players, as it is short and relatively easy. There are plenty of enemies to fight, and the final boss can be tricky but is not too difficult.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>The Tombs of Kelnozz</li>
</ol>
<p>This dungeon is a bit longer than some of the others on this list, but it is still manageable for a new player. There are plenty of enemies to fight, and the final boss can be challenging but not impossible.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>The Mines of Moria</li>
</ol>
<p>This dungeon is a good choice for players who are looking for a challenge. It is longer than some of the others on this list, and there are plenty of difficult enemies along the way. However, the final boss can be defeated fairly easily with some careful planning.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>The Temple of Atal’Hakkar</li>
</ol>
<p>This dungeon is one of the longest on this list, but it is also one of the most challenging. There are many difficult enemies along the way, and the final boss can be quite tricky to beat. If you’re looking for a challenge, this is definitely the dungeon for you!</p>
<h1 id="The-5-Worst-Dungeons-for-Gaining-Loot-and-XP-in-Wildz"><a href="#The-5-Worst-Dungeons-for-Gaining-Loot-and-XP-in-Wildz" class="headerlink" title="The 5 Worst Dungeons for Gaining Loot and XP in Wildz"></a>The 5 Worst Dungeons for Gaining Loot and XP in Wildz</h1><p>There are plenty of dungeons littered throughout Wildz that offer great experiences and rewards for players looking to gain levels and loot. Conversely, there are also a handful of dungeons that should be avoided at all costs if you want to make any progress in the game.</p>
<p>Here are the 5 worst dungeons for gaining loot and XP in Wildz:</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>The Goblin Crypts</li>
</ol>
<p>The Goblin Crypts can be found in the northeast corner of the map and is one of the easier dungeons in Wildz. However, it offers very little in terms of rewards, making it a poor choice for anyone looking to advance in the game.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Britannia Castle</li>
</ol>
<p>Britannia Castle is located in the middle of the map and is home to some of the strongest enemies in Wildz. While it does offer decent rewards upon completion, it’s much too difficult for most players to reach that point. Unless you’re high-leveled and geared up, you’re better off avoiding Britannia Castle altogether.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>The Dragon Temple</li>
</ol>
<p>The Dragon Temple is a treacherous dungeon located on the edge of the map that is home to some of the strongest enemies in Wildz. It offers great rewards for those who can make it through, but it is extremely difficult and only recommended for high-level players.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>The Prison of Despair</li>
</ol>
<p>The Prison of Despair can be found in the southeast corner of the map and is one of the most difficult dungeons in Wildz. It offers great rewards, but most players will not be able to reach them due to its challenging nature. If you’re looking to get ahead in Wildz, avoid this dungeon at all cost!</p>
<ol>
<li>The Maze of Shadows</li>
</ol>
<p>The Maze of Shadows is by far the worst dungeon for gaining loot and XP in Wildz. It’s a long and difficult dungeon with no real reward at the end aside from experience points. If you want to make any progress in this game, stay away from The Maze of Shadows!</p>
