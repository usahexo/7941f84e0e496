        <h1 id="Nevada-gambling-revenue-up-on-account-of-legalized-sports-betting"><a href="#Nevada-gambling-revenue-up-on-account-of-legalized-sports-betting" class="headerlink" title="Nevada gambling revenue up on account of legalized sports betting"></a>Nevada gambling revenue up on account of legalized sports betting</h1><p>Governor Steve Sisolak of Nevada has announced that the state’s gambling revenue has increased by $7m in the month of June, primarily on account of legalized sports betting. This is great news for the state, as it continues to reap the benefits of legalized gambling.</p>
<p>The increase in revenue was largely due to an increase in betting on football, basketball, and baseball. In particular, there was a 63% increase in betting on baseball, which is now the most popular sport to bet on in Nevada.</p>
<p>This increase in revenue is good news for the state budget, as it helps to offset some of the costs associated with legalized gambling. It also helps to create jobs and support businesses in the state.</p>
<p>Nevada is one of only a few states that have legalized sports betting, and it is quickly becoming one of the most popular ways to gamble. In fact, more than $1bn was wagered on sports in Nevada last year, and this number is likely to continue to grow in the years ahead.</p>
<p>So far, the legalization of sports betting has been a big success for Nevada. Not only has it generated more revenue for the state, but it has also created jobs and supported businesses. It will be interesting to see how this trend continues in the years ahead.</p>
<h1 id="Delaware’s-athletics-gamble-pays-off-as-legal-bets-placed-there-exceed-1-million"><a href="#Delaware’s-athletics-gamble-pays-off-as-legal-bets-placed-there-exceed-1-million" class="headerlink" title="Delaware’s athletics gamble pays off as legal bets placed there exceed $1 million"></a>Delaware’s athletics gamble pays off as legal bets placed there exceed $1 million</h1><p>In May of 2018, Delaware became the first state outside of Nevada to offer full-scale legal sports betting. A little over a year later, the gamble has paid off as betting there has already exceeded $1 million.</p>
<p>The culprit for this surge in gambling is the NFL, whose popularity has exploded in recent years. In 2017, the NFL’s TV ratings hit an all-time high, and that interest has only continued to grow in 2018. Fans are no longer content to just watch games on TV; they now want to place bets on them as well.</p>
<p>This is particularly true in Delaware, where fans have always been passionate about their sports teams. The University of Delaware Blue Hens, for example, have a huge following in the state. And with legal sports betting now available, more and more people are placing bets on their games.</p>
<p>Delaware’s success with legal sports betting shows that other states would be wise to follow its lead. Other than Nevada, only a few states currently offer legal sports betting, and this number is likely to grow in the coming years. With the NFL becoming increasingly popular, it’s clear that legal sports betting is here to stay.</p>
<h1 id="Connecticut-generates-300-000-in-tax-earnings-from-4-months-of-sports-betting"><a href="#Connecticut-generates-300-000-in-tax-earnings-from-4-months-of-sports-betting" class="headerlink" title="Connecticut generates $300,000 in tax earnings from 4 months of sports betting"></a>Connecticut generates $300,000 in tax earnings from 4 months of sports betting</h1><p>Governor Dannel Malloy and Connecticut legislators announced that the state has generated nearly $300,000 in tax revenue from sports betting in the first four months since it became legal. This is good news for a state that is facing a significant budget deficit.</p>
<p>The state began taking legal sports bets on November 15, 2018 and has since raked in $297,000 in taxes. This is just a fraction of the estimated $35 to $100 million that will be generated annually from sports gambling, but it is a good start. The state projects that it will generate over $2 million in tax revenue from sports betting in the current fiscal year.</p>
<p>The money from sports betting will help to close Connecticut’s budget deficit, which is estimated at $1.7 billion. Governor Malloy said that the money from sports betting would help to offset cuts to essential services, such as education and social services.</p>
<p>Connecticut is one of eight states that have legalized sports betting since the Supreme Court struck down a federal ban on the activity in May 2018. Delaware was the first state to begin taking legal bets, followed by New Jersey, West Virginia, Mississippi, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Nevada.</p>
<h1 id="New-Mexico-sees-decrease-in-unlawful-sports-activities-betting-because-it-becomes-authorized"><a href="#New-Mexico-sees-decrease-in-unlawful-sports-activities-betting-because-it-becomes-authorized" class="headerlink" title="New Mexico sees decrease in unlawful sports activities betting because it becomes authorized"></a>New Mexico sees decrease in unlawful sports activities betting because it becomes authorized</h1><p>In Could, New Mexico grew to become the most recent state to legalize sports activities betting after the U.S. Supreme Courtroom overturned a federal ban. The ruling gave states the best to legalize and control sports activities betting of their very own jurisdictions.</p>
<p>This move was anticipated to result in a big surge in unlawful sports actions betting as residents made use of unregulated and black market choices. Nevertheless, this has not been the case in New Mexico.</p>
<p>Whereas there has been an uptick in sports activities betting since legalization, it has not been as dramatic because the naysayers have prompt. In truth, unlawful sports activities betting is down almost 20% since Might.</p>
<p>This can be a clear signal that when states provide authorized and regulated choices, residents are extra likely to make use of them fairly than take part within the black market. It additionally exhibits that legalizing sports activities betting doesn’t inevitably lead to increased ranges of crime and corruption.</p>
<p>New Mexico is now proof level for different states contemplating legalizing sports activities betting. It seems that offering a authorized and accountable choice does not create extra issues; it merely provides an choice for these eager to gamble on sporting occasions.</p>
<h1 id="More-states-legalizing-sports-activities-betting-as-income-potential-is-identified"><a href="#More-states-legalizing-sports-activities-betting-as-income-potential-is-identified" class="headerlink" title="More states legalizing sports activities betting as income potential is identified"></a>More states legalizing sports activities betting as income potential is identified</h1><p>As the legalization of cannabis proceeds coast to coast, it appears that some states are looking to sports activities betting as a new revenue supply. Delaware and New Jersey have currently joined Nevada in legalizing sports betting, with other states like West Virginia and Illinois wanting to comply with accommodate.</p>
<p>While there are those who argue that this is a slippery slope that will lead to integrity difficulties in athletics, there is no question that legalizing sports activities betting will produce considerable income for state governments. In Nevada, which has had legalized athletics betting considering that 1931, it accounts for $three billion in yearly income.</p>
<p>“I feel it really is hypocritical for any one of these states to say we can legalize marijuana but not legalize sporting activities gambling,” said Rep. Michael Sturla of Pennsylvania, who is sponsoring a bill to legalize sports betting in his state. “If you are going to allow the two, then why not just let people gamble?”</p>
<p>It would appear that lawmakers and the public alike are beginning to see the real potential in legalized sports activities betting as a way to increase state revenue. With many states now generating great money from cannabis sales, it looks like athletics gambling may possibly soon be another authorized way for states to make extra cash.</p>
