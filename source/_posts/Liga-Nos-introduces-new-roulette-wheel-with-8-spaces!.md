#  Liga Nos introduces new roulette wheel with 8 spaces!

The Portuguese top-flight football league, Liga Nos, has announced a new format for the forthcoming season. The main change is the introduction of a roulette wheel which will have 8 spaces, 4 of which will be allocated to clubs automatically qualified for the following season's UEFA Champions League (UCL).

The remaining 4 spaces on the wheel will be filled through a playoffs system that includes all the teams in Liga Nos. The playoffs will be contested in a two-legged format, with the winner qualifying for the UCL.

This new system has been met with mixed reactions by fans and pundits alike. Some people argue that it is unfair to teams that have to go through the playoffs, while others claim that it adds an extra layer of excitement to the league.

The Liga Nos has announced a revamped roulette wheel for the 2019/20 season, which will see two extra spaces added.
