#  Exactly what age can you go in to a casino in New Jersey?

In the state of New Jersey, the legal age to enter a casino is 21. This applies to all Atlantic City casinos, with the exception of those on Native American land, which typically have their own set of rules regarding gambling and casino entry age.

Exceptions may be made for players who are 18 years old or older if they are accompanied by a parent or legal guardian. In such cases, both the player and the accompanying adult must present valid identification at the door.

It's worth noting that casinos in other states may have different age requirements. For example, in Nevada the minimum legal age is 18, while in Pennsylvania it's 21. So if you're traveling to a casino that's not in New Jersey, be sure to check the regulations in that jurisdiction before you go.

#  Are there any restrictions on what games you can play?

This is a question that has been asked by many people, and there is no definitive answer. The restrictions may vary depending on the country of residence, as different countries have different laws concerning gambling.

Generally speaking, most countries allow you to play any type of game you like. There are a few exceptions, such as Australia which prohibits certain types of casino games, but in general you should be able to play any game you like.

There are a few things to keep in mind, however. Always make sure you are aware of the rules and regulations in your country before playing any games – this way you can be sure that you are not breaking any laws. Secondly, it is important to only gamble with money that you can afford to lose – remember, gambling is always risky and you could end up losing everything.

So, are there any restrictions on what games you can play? In most cases, no – you can play whatever game takes your fancy. Just be sure to familiarise yourself with the relevant laws in your country beforehand, and only gamble with money that you can afford to lose.

#  Can you drink alcohol while gambling?

The simple answer to this question is yes, you can drink alcohol while gambling. However, there are a few things to keep in mind if you want to make the most of your gambling experience while enjoying a drink or two.

First and foremost, it's important to be aware of the fact that alcohol can impact your judgement and your ability to make rational decisions. This means that if you're drinking, it's best not to gamble with any money that you can't afford to lose. Secondly, alcohol can also affect your motor skills, so it's important to be careful when playing games such as blackjack or poker. If you're feeling drunk, it might be a good idea to stick to betting on slot machines or other games that don't require any skill. Finally, remember that alcohol is a depressant and can make you feel tired – so if you're planning on spending an entire night at the casino, it might be a good idea to avoid drinking too much.

Assuming that you take all of these things into account, drinking alcohol while gambling can be a fun and enjoyable experience. Just be sure to stay safe and responsible while doing so!

#  Is there a dress code for casino visitors?

Casino dress code is something that you should be aware of before planning your visit. Most casinos have a smart casual dress code, but there may be some that require a full formal wear. Generally, men should avoid wearing shorts and sleeveless shirts, while women should avoid wearing miniskirts and plunging necklines. It’s also important to remember that while you are in the casino, you are representing the casino so it is important to dress appropriately.

#  What kind of gambling facilities are available at casinos in New Jersey?

There are different kinds of gambling available at casinos in New Jersey, depending on the casino. Atlantic City casinos offer both table games and slot machines. The Borgata, Caesars, Harrah's, and MGM offer a mix of table games like blackjack, craps, and roulette, as well as slots. Bally's, Golden Nugget, Tropicana, and Trump Plaza have more slot machines than table games.

In addition to slots and table games, some casinos offer sports betting. The Borgata and Monmouth Park Racetrack offer sports betting, while the Atlantic City Race Course does not. Monmouth Park Racetrack also offers off-track betting on horses.

Some casinos also offer poker rooms. The Borgata has one of the largest poker rooms in Atlantic City, while Trump Taj Mahal does not have a poker room.
