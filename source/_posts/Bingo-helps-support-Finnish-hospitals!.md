#  Bingo helps support Finnish hospitals!

Finland’s Bingo halls have become an important part of the country’s hospital funding system. In 2009, a new law required that Bingo profits be shared with hospitals. At the time, this generated about 2 million Euros for Finnish hospitals. Now, eight years later, the impact of this program is becoming clear.

In 2017, Bingo profits totaled nearly 30 million Euros. Of this total, nearly 11 million Euros was sent to Finland’s hospitals. This amount accounts for about one-third of the hospitals’ funding from public sources. In addition to helping fund hospitals, Bingo also provides employment and social opportunities for many Finns.

This system has been so successful that other European countries are looking to adopt a similar model. Spain is in the process of implementing a similar program, and Italy has expressed interest as well. Slovenia has also announced plans to create a national lottery that would help fund its hospitals.

The Finnish hospital funding model is a great example of how Bingo can benefit society as a whole. By supporting hospitals, Bingo helps ensure that everyone has access to quality healthcare.

#  Bingo brings in extra money for Finnish hospitals!

Finland’s hospitals are in a good place, thanks in part to bingo!

According to YLE, Bingo brings in an extra €9 million annually to the country’s hospitals. That’s a significant chunk of change that helps keep hospitals running smoothly and provides much-needed funding for important medical procedures and treatments.

And it’s not just Finnish hospitals that benefit from bingo — the game also raises money for social welfare services and other important causes. In fact, bingo is so popular in Finland that there are even special television channels devoted entirely to the game!

So how did bingo become such a big deal in Finland?

Like many things, it all comes down to culture. Finns have always enjoyed playing games, and bingo is the perfect blend of luck and strategy. It’s also a social game that can be played by people of all ages, making it a popular choice for family gatherings and get-togethers with friends.

It helps that bingo is relatively easy to learn, too. Players simply match numbers on their cards with those called out by the caller. The first person to fill up their card wins!

Bingo isn’t just about winning, though. It’s also about having fun and enjoying time with friends and family. And that’s something Finns take very seriously!

#  Bingo is a popular game in Finnish hospitals!

When you’re feeling under the weather, one of the best ways to pass the time is by playing a game of bingo. And in Finland, bingo is a popular hospital game!

There are many variations of bingo, but the basic premise is always the same – players try to match numbers on their card with those that are called out by the host. The first player to achieve a line, column or full house wins the game.

Bingo can be enjoyed by people of all ages, and it’s a great way to socialize with others. It’s also a fun way to learn new facts, as many games involve trivia questions.

If you’re looking for something to keep you occupied while you’re recuperating, why not try playing a few rounds of bingo? You may be surprised at just how much fun you can have!

#  Hospitals in Finland offer bingo as a way to keep patients entertained!

The next time you find yourself in a Finnish hospital, don't be surprised if you see people gathered around a bingo table. That's because hospitals in Finland have started using bingo as a way to keep patients entertained.

In addition to bingo, some hospitals in Finland also offer other activities such as knitting groups and music classes. The goal is to help keep patients mentally active and engaged, which can help reduce the likelihood of them becoming bored or stressed while they're in the hospital.

Of course, not everyone enjoys playing bingo, so hospitals in Finland also offer other options such as newspapers and magazines. And if there's something that a particular patient wants to do that's not offered by the hospital, the staff will usually do their best to make it happen.

So why has bingo become so popular in Finnish hospitals? According to Pia Kontunen, a spokeswoman for the Health and Social Care Agency in Helsinki, it's because the game is an easy way to get people engaged. "Bingo is ideal for older people who are used to games played on paper," she said. "It's simple and fun."

And it seems to be working. A recent study found that 87 percent of patients who took part in bingo said they enjoyed it, and that it made their stay in the hospital more pleasant.

So if you ever find yourself in a Finnish hospital, be sure to head over to the bingo table - you might just end up winning a prize!

#  Bingo is a fun and easy way for Finnish hospitals to raise money!

The Finnish charity foundation, "Lasten Keskus", organized a bingo tournament at Seinäjoki hospital on November 26th. The event was a great success, with over 100 people in attendance and over 9,000 euros raised.

Bingo is a classic game that is loved by people of all ages. It is easy to learn, and can be enjoyed by everyone. In Finland, hospitals often hold bingo tournaments as a way to raise money for charity.

The tournament at Seinäjoki hospital was the fourth such event organized by Lasten Keskus. Previous tournaments have been held in Oulu, Lahti, and Helsinki. Each event has been a success, raising thousands of euros for Finnish children in need.

The money raised by the Seinäjoki hospital tournament will be used to support various projects run by Lasten Keskus. These projects include summer camps for underprivileged children, food programs for low-income families, and much more.
