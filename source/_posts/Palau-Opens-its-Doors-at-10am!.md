The Palau National Government has announced that its doors will open at 10am from Monday to Friday, starting from July 9th, 2018.

The announcement was made by President Remengesau through a memorandum released on Sunday, stating the government's amended hours of operation.

The new hours will also be in effect for all state agencies and instrumentalities, except for the Koror State Government which will maintain its existing hours of 8am to 5pm.

One of the world’s most undiscovered and pristine travel destinations is Palau. Located in the western Pacific Ocean, it’s made up of more than 300 islands and reefs that are teeming with marine life. Snorkeling and diving are among the top activities here, as well as fishing, kayaking, and camping. If you can find a spot on the beach that isn’t already taken, you can relax and take in the incredible views.

Despite its remote location, Palau is gaining popularity as a tourist destination. This means that if you want to visit before the crowds arrive, you need to book your trip soon! Here are some tips for making the most of your time in Palau:

1. Fly into Koror Island – The airport on Koror is where most visitors arrive and is also home to the only town on Palau. There aren’t many hotels or restaurants here, so if you don’t have a place to stay or plan on eating out every night, you may want to consider flying into one of the other airports on the island.

2. Rent a car – Once you’re in Koror, driving is your best way to get around. The roads aren’t great, but they’re passable and it’s definitely worth renting a car so that you can explore all of the different islands.

3. Get an idea of what islands you want to visit – There are over 200 islands in Palau, but not all of them are worth visiting. Some are just small uninhabited rocks while others have resorts and infrastructure. Do some research before your trip to decide which ones you want to see.

4. Book tours and activities in advance – Like I said earlier, Palau is becoming more popular every day and many of the popular activities book up fast. If there’s something specific that you want to do (like snorkeling with turtles), make sure to book it ahead of time.

5. Go during the off-season – If possible, try to go during the off-season (May-November). Not only will it be cheaper, but there will also be less people around which means more peace and quiet for you!
