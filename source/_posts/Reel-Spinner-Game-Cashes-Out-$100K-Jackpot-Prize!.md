#  Isle of Capri Casino Bossier City Louisiana Spin Reel Winner!

We ventured over to the Isle of Capri Casino Bossier City Louisiana this past weekend in search of some fun and maybe a bit of good luck! Our mission was successful on both fronts! The fun we had was contagious and our luck was pretty great too! In fact, we hit the jackpot on one of the slot machines – talk about a winning day!

We spent most of our time playing the “Reel Deal” slots and it didn’t take long for us to figure out which ones were the best contenders. We would start with a few spins on one machine and, if we weren’t winning, we would move on to another one. It wasn’t long before we found ourselves glued to one specific machine – the Spin Reel Winner!

This particular slot machine had started paying out some pretty good wins fairly consistently and we were determined to see if we could keep that trend going. With every spin, we got a little more excited as the wins kept piling up! In the end, we walked away with $420 in our pockets – not too bad for a couple hours of fun!
