The announcement of the Rikvip Bowl came as a surprise to many people. Liga Nos and La Liga are two of the top football leagues in Europe. Why were they not included in the UEFA Champions League or UEFA Europa League? 

There are a few reasons for why Liga Nos and La Liga teams are competing in the Rikvip Bowl. One reason is money. The UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League generate a lot of money for their respective leagues. By not being part of these tournaments, Liga Nos and La Liga lose out on a lot of money. 

Another reason is exposure. The UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League get a lot of worldwide exposure. This exposure helps build the brand of Liga Nos and La Liga. By competing in the Rikvip Bowl, these leagues can get more exposure outside of Europe. 

Finally, there is the issue of politics. Some people believe that UEFA does not want Liga Nos and La Liga to compete against each other because it could hurt the ratings of their tournaments. This could be another reason why Liga Nos and La Liga are competing in the Rikvip Bowl.
