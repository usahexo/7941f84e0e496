#  What Fuels a Gambling Addiction?

When gambling, the brain is releasing dopamine — a feel-good neurotransmitter.



Gambling addicts keep seeking that dopamine hit, even if it means risking everything they have. What's going on in their brains that leads to this type of addictive behavior?

Dopamine is well known as the "reward hormone." It's responsible for the euphoria we feel when we do something enjoyable, like eat chocolate or listen to our favorite song.

In people with gambling addictions, dopamine is released in response to risky behaviors too. This may be why these individuals find gambling so addicting; it's essentially providing them with a high similar to what they'd get from drugs or alcohol.

The problem is that over time, the brain becomes less responsive to dopamine. So when an addicted gambler does gamble, they need to take bigger risks in order to experience the same rush. This can lead to disastrous consequences, including financial ruin and ruined relationships.

So what's happening in the brains of gambling addicts that leads to all this chaos? Studies suggest that there may be some differences in the way addicted gamblers' brains process dopamine.

For one, addicted gamblers seem to have more sensitive "reward regions" of the brain. This could explain why they're more likely to become addicted to gambling than someone who doesn't have these regions are as sensitive.Additionally, addicted gamblers may have less activity in their "inhibitory regions." This could make them more impulsive and more likely to take risks while gambling.
