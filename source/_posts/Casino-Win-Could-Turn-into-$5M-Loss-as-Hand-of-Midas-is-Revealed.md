#  High Stakes Gambler Wins $5 Million Playing Hand of Midas Slot

When it comes to casino games, there are a few that are considered high-risk, high-reward. Blackjack and poker are two prime examples. However, when it comes to steady payouts with the potential for huge wins, few games beat out the slot machines. Earlier this week, one high stakes gambler proved just that by winning over $5 million while playing the Hand of Midas slot machine at an Atlantic City casino.

The gambler, who has not been identified, is said to have made the massive win playing a $10 bet on a single spin of the reels. The Hand of Midas is a 5-reel slot machine with 25 paylines and a top jackpot of 10,000x the player's wager. In other words, if you bet $10 on a single spin and hit the jackpot, you would walk away with $100,000.

While it's not clear exactly how long the gambler had been playing before hitting the jackpot, it's safe to say that he or she was likely feeling pretty lucky by the end. In fact, this might just be the luckiest gambling win ever recorded!

The gamble feature allows players to risk their winnings in order to potentially double them. Simply choose whether you think the next card will be black or red, and if you guess correctly then your winnings will be doubled. If you guess incorrectly, then you will lose your entire payout.

The scatter symbol is represented by an image of King Midas himself and can award players with up to 100x their total bet amount. If three or more scatter symbols appear anywhere on the reels, then players will trigger the free spins bonus round.
