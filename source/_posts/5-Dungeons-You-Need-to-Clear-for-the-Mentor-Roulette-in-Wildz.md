#  5 Dungeons Every Player Should Clear For the Mentor Roulette

Once you hit level 60, it's time to start gearing up for The Mentor Roulette. This is a high-level dungeon where you can receive powerful rewards - but only if your team is up to the challenge.

If you're looking to maximize your chances of success, you'll want to clear five specific dungeons first. Here's a list of them, along with some tips on how to beat them:

1. Maze of the Blue Dragon

This dungeon is all about teamwork and strategy. The key to clearing it is to focus on taking out the blue dragons first. Don't let them breathe fire on your party, or you'll be in for a tough battle.

2. Hammerknell Fortress

This is a difficult dungeon, but the rewards are well worth it. Make sure to take advantage of the choke points in the hallway, and have a healer ready to go for the final boss fight.

3. Sanctum of Blood

This dungeon can be tricky if you're not prepared for it. The best way to deal with the bosses is to use ranged DPS characters and keep your healer alive.

4. The Lost City of Teshar

This dungeon is all about timing and speed. You'll need to move quickly through the rooms and avoid the traps - otherwise, you'll be in for a long battle.

5. The Court of Oryx

#  The 5 Worst Dungeons for Gaining Loot and XP in Wildz

There are plenty of dungeons littered throughout Wildz that offer great experiences and rewards for players looking to gain levels and loot. Conversely, there are also a handful of dungeons that should be avoided at all costs if you want to make any progress in the game.

3. The Dragon Temple

The Dragon Temple is a treacherous dungeon located on the edge of the map that is home to some of the strongest enemies in Wildz. It offers great rewards for those who can make it through, but it is extremely difficult and only recommended for high-level players.

2. The Prison of Despair

The Prison of Despair can be found in the southeast corner of the map and is one of the most difficult dungeons in Wildz.
