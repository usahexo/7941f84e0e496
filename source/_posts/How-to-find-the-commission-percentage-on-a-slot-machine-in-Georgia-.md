When you are playing slot machines in Georgia, it is important to know the commission percentage for each machine. This number tells you how much of your money the casino will keep in order to pay out winning players. The commission percentage can vary from machine to machine, so it is important to find one that has a lower percentage if you want to have a better chance of winning money.
