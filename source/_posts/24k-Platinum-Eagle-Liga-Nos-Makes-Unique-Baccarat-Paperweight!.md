#  Rare Liga Nos Coin Makes Stunning Baccarat Paperweight!

In Baccarat, two hands are dealt-one designated the "Player" hand and the other the "Banker" hand. The object of the game is to bet on which of these two hands will be closer to nine. In addition to betting on the player or banker hands, players may also bet on a tie.

There are three possible outcomes in Baccarat-Player Win, Banker Win, and Tie. The Player Hand can only win or lose by one point; if it has a value of eight or nine at the end of the play, it is called a Natural and no other cards are played. Similarly, the Banker Hand can only win or lose by one point; if it has a value of eight or nine at the end of the play, it is called a Natural and no other cards are played. If both hands have values other than natural (0-7), then an additional card is drawn for each hand and their sum is compared to 9.

The rare Liga Nos coin that was recently used as a paperweight for a baccarat table makes for an interesting story. The coin is from Portugal and has a face value of 5 Euros. It was minted in 2006 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Liga Nos, which is the top professional football league in Portugal. The coin bears an image of King José I on one side and the coat of arms of Portugal on the other side.

While there are certainly many different types of coins that could be used as paperweights, this particular Liga Nos coin happens to be quite unique due to its high value and rarity. Only 207,500 coins were minted, so it's not often that you see one in circulation. In fact, there were only six specimens graded by NGC as being "Prooflike" quality, making this particular coin even more rare and valuable.

So why was this particular Liga Nos coin used as a paperweight? It turns out that there was an issue with one of the baccarat tables at The Palazzo Resort-Hotel-Casino in Las Vegas. Apparently, one corner of the table was raised higher than the others, which caused some new decks of cards placed near the edge to slide off onto the floor. Rather than try to fix the table or move it to another spot in the casino, someone came up with the idea to place a Liga No coin under one corner of the table to hold down the cards. This seemed to work well enough that someone decided to make it a permanent solution by using a Liga No coin as a paperweight for all four corners of the table!

In 1897, the American Glassware Company introduced a new paperweight style. This paperweight was made with a round disc of clear glass in the center and an outer ring of colorful stained glass. The design was popular and remained in production for many years.

While these paperweights were often quite plain, some were decorated with images or scenes. One of the more interesting designs is the baccarat paperweight with a 24k platinum eagle liga nos. This paperweight features a colorful image of an eagle perched on a branch. The bird has brightly-colored feathers and is surrounded by a halo of light.

This paperweight is quite rare and highly sought after by collectors. It is believed that only about 100 examples of this design were ever made. Due to its rarity, it can be quite expensive when sold at auction. In 2007, one example sold at auction for over $7,500.
